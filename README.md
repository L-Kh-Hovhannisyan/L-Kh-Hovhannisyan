### About

For those who don't know me, I'm autistic. Asperger's Syndrome to be precise.
<p>
Many of us were considered failures of a sort in school, outcasts, rejects. To us school was a nightmare from which there was no end, but then there was the end, and at that end we found salvation in technology.
<p>
This is a subject which has always troubled me, an assertion that one can behave poorly because one is autistic. Perhaps it's because of or some other permutation, but let's start with a very simple truth: Being autistic does not make you a jerk, nor does it ever give you license to be one.
I have spent all my life with people saying I'm weird, well yes I am and proud of being different, unique and quirky. I've stuggle all my life with fitting into Society, and being what people call Normal, although what is Normal Anyway?. I can't change who I am, and wouldn't want to just to fit in. 
<p>
Iâ€™ve not put this post up for Sympathy, Support or Approval from anyone, itâ€™s about Awareness, Understanding and Acceptance. Being an Aspie comes with its challenges both Mentally and Physically, which is difficult for people to understand because what you canâ€™t see you canâ€™t understand. Even being an Aspie itâ€™s hard to Understand why your brain is in overload permanently, uncomfortable in social situations & difficult to express feelings. 
<p>
Although Iâ€™m very fortunate and blessed to have amazing, supportive and caring mother. And Iâ€™m very proud of myself for always trying to Endeavour everything I do without support, despite the challenges & attributes of Aspergers.
<p>
Since childhood I have been fond of contemplation, well, if you can call it that. I disassembled everything that I could understand at home, looked at how it was arranged, tried to understand how it works ... And now, years later I managed to carry this contemplation of the technological sphere of the Earth (or technium in other words).

### Education
Iâ€™m currently doing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="https://shsu.am/en/">Shirak State University</a>.

### Skills
Advanced knowledge of 5 programming languages (Python, C/C++/C#, Verilog) and related fields (Network/CISCO, Linux, Bash-scripting, HTML, CSS, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker, Git, SVN, Apache, etc.). Websites creation, OpenSource projects deployments, applications development, building, testing and deployments - are the things everyday I'm working with and in what I'm improving my skills constantly.

### Interests

- I am an computer science engineer by formal education and work full time as an software engineer. I discovered a love for pure mathematics during my bachelor studies in applied mathematics. So now I self-study pure mathematics as a hobby!
- Currently working on machine learning projects. 
My interests include software design and development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.
- I am always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new people to collaborate with. Do check out my repositories and feel free to reach out if you would like to work on any of my existing projects or if you think that I would be a good fit in your project.
